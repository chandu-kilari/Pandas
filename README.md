COVID-19 Data Analysis and Population Integration
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing COVID-19 data and integrating it with population information to extract meaningful insights. The analysis includes data cleaning, wrangling, trend visualization, and country-level comparisons to answer critical questions about the pandemic's global impact.

Features
Data Cleaning:

Handling missing values in key columns (Confirmed, Deaths, Recovered).
Identifying and capping outliers for accurate analysis.
Data Wrangling:

Aggregating COVID-19 data by country and date.
Merging with population data to compute per-capita metrics.
Country-Level Analysis:

Ranking countries by total confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.
Calculating fatality rates and cases per capita.
Trend Analysis:

Visualizing trends of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries over time for specific countries (e.g., India).
Computing weekly aggregates and rolling averages to smooth fluctuations.
Final Report:

Summarizing total confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and fatality rates for each country.
Exporting the analysis results to a CSV file.
Project Workflow
Data Collection:

Input datasets:
noisy_covid_data.csv: Raw COVID-19 data.
population_data.csv: Population statistics for each country.
Data Cleaning:

Replacing missing values with defaults (e.g., 0).
Removing or capping extreme outliers for consistent metrics.
Data Integration:

Merging COVID-19 data with population data to compute cases per capita.
Data Analysis:

Aggregating country-level metrics.
Visualizing trends using line plots and rolling averages.
Output:

Key insights stored in yourname_hashInclude.csv for further analysis or presentation.
